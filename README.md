# Abnormal behavior detection
Abnormal behavior detection is a critical task in various domains, including video surveillance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. The main objective is to identify actions or patterns that deviate significantly from expected or normal behavior, which may indicate potential threats, accidents, or unusual events.


UCSD Ped1 Dataset

The UCSD Ped1 dataset is a widely used benchmark for abnormal behavior detection, provided by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). It consists of videos captured from a fixed camera overlooking a pedestrian walkway. Abnormal behaviors in these videos include individuals riding bicycles, skateboards, or using wheelchairsâ€”actions that deviate from normal pedestrian behavior.

Features:

Videos captured at moderate resolution

Rare abnormal events

Ground truth annotations for evaluation

ðŸ“Š UCSD Ped2 Dataset

The UCSD Ped2 dataset is an enhanced version of Ped1, also recorded from fixed cameras overlooking different pedestrian walkways. Abnormal behaviors include riding bicycles, skateboards, or other unusual movements in a pedestrian area. Ped2 is often used to test the generalization of models trained on Ped1.

Features:

Videos at moderate resolution

Rare abnormal events
